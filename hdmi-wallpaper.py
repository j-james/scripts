# 1) The victim needs to have either `feh` or `nitrogen` installed.
# 2) The prankster needs to know the location (or have a copy) of
#   the victim's usual wallpaper.
# 3) Python 3.

# If wanted, this can be configured to launch on start from various
# places - .profile, .i3/config, etc
# Use the following line: `cd ~/[ location of script ] && python hdmi-background.py`
